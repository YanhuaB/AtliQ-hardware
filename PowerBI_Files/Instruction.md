# How to access the report

GitHub does not provide functionality to execute Power BI files (.pbix) directly within its interface. To access the file, it must be downloaded to your local device and opened using Power BI Desktop.

Alternatively, screenshots of the dashboard have been uploaded to the ["dashboards" folder](PowerBI_Files/dashboards). These images offer an overview of the report, allowing for a visual representation of the dashboard's contents.

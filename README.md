# Sales Insights of AtliQ hardware- Brick & Mortar business

## Project Description
Built a three-perspective dashboard in a real-life scenario, providing sales insights to support data-driven decision-making 
and empowering non-technical stakeholders with accessible and intelligible information. In this project, improved data accuracy 
by deduplicating raw data, normalizing currency, and cleaning infeasible sales quantities, resulting in the removal of 5% of 
low-quality data. Integrated a MySQL database with Power BI and structured data modeling, identifying and mapping key relationships 
among five tables using primary and foreign keys. Conducted ETL operations in Power Query Editor for dashboard creation, saving 75% 
of the time on data processing.
